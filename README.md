**Brief abstract:** Interactions between and within abiotic and biotic processes generate non-additive density-dependent effects on species performance that can vary in strength or direction across environments. If ignored, non-additivities can lead to inaccurate predictions of species responses to environmental and compositional changes. While there are increasing empirical efforts to test the constancy of pairwise biotic interactions along environmental and compositional gradients, few assess both simultaneously. Using a nationwide forest inventory that spans broad ambient temperature and moisture gradients throughout New Zealand, we address this gap by analysing diameter growth of six focal tree species as a function of neighbour densities and climate, as well as neighbour $\times$ climate and neighbour $\times$ neighbour statistical interactions. The most complex model featuring all interaction terms had the highest predictive accuracy. Compared to climate variables, biotic interactions typically had stronger effects on diameter growth, especially when subjected to non-additivities from local climatic conditions and the density of intermediary species. Furthermore, statistically strong (or weak) non-additivities could be biologically irrelevant (or significant) depending on whether a species pair typically interacted under average or more extreme conditions. Our study highlights the importance of considering both the statistical potential and the biological relevance of non-additive biotic interactions when assessing species performance under global change.
